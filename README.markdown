# Accordion README

Accordion is a small project for iOS that implements file navigation using accordions. Accordion aims to be a persistent layer between your TableView and your files on disk. And hopefully become an alternative to UINavigationController for files. Assuring its consistency bringing full customization, editing (creation and deletion of files) and sorting (when viewing files) capabilities and in future versions I will implement arrangement of these. I am still busy writing code ;)

Accordion is under MIT Licence so if you find it helpfull just use it :D

*Accordion1:*
Is the very first implementation, left for historical purposes :)

*Accordion2:*
Is the version I am working on, is much better but still lacking of some features, I hope I can have full version by the end of June or beggining of July 2011.

Any comments are welcomed
